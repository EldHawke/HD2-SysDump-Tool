# Notes (Work in Progress)

## 🛠️ Things to Add
- [ ] **Windows Fast Startup** → **OFF**  
  _(prevents GG’s service from waking in a half-broken state)_
- [ ] Add **HD2** and **GG** to Defender exclusions  
  `...\steamapps\common\Helldivers 2\`
- [ ] Disable **IPv6** (possibly include in DNS fix)
- [ ] Add sfc/dsim and chkdsk checks
- [ ] Simple RAM test - check for bad memory blocks
- [ ] Add options to uninstall known issue hotfixes

## 🔍 Things to Research
- [ ] Investigate **GG HID hook detection** → scan for similar apps
- [ ] Learn more about **GG** and **DEP**
- [ ] Test further with **Steam’s ping-per-minute**

## Dropped/Not working
- ~~[ ] Disable **ClickToRunSvc** service~~ - breaks outlook and other MS apps
