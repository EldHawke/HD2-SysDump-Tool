Just notes for now:  
  Thing to add:
    Windows Fast Startup = OFF (avoids GGâ€™s service from waking half-broken)
    Add HD2 and GG to defender exclusions (...\steamapps\common\Helldivers 2\)
    Disable service ClickToRunSvc
    Disable ipv6 (add to DNS fix?)
  Things to research:
    Figure out GG HID hook detection to scan for similar apps
    Figure out more about GG and DEP
    Test more with steams ping per minute
